EO4GEO is an Erasmus+ Sector Skills Alliance involving 26 core and 22 associated partners from 16 countries from academia, private and public sector active in the education/training and space/geospatial sectors. EO4GEO aims to help bridging the skills gap between supply and demand of education and training in the space/geospatial sector by reinforcing the existing ecosystem and fostering the uptake and integration of space/geospatial data and services in end-user applications. EO4GEO is preparing a strategy and long term action plan, will develop a Body of Knowledge (BoK) for GI & EO and a collaborative platform with associated tools, design a portfolio of VET curricula which will be tested for several sub-sectors including smart cities, climate change and integrated applications.
