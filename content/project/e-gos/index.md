title: E-GOS - Effective Governance of Open Spatial Data
summary: The central research question this project aims to answer is 'what is the impact of different models for governing open spatial data on the performance of open spatial data policies in Europe?'. To answer this question, a case study approach was implemented, analysing two countries that are among the leading open data countries in the world, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom

In the past 20 years, European public authorities have invested considerable resources in the development of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs). With the European INSPIRE Directive as an important driver, national SDIs were developed throughout Europe to facilitate and coordinate the exchange and sharing of geographic data. These SDIs initially focused on data sharing among public authorities. Together with the implementation of open data policies to make government data available and reusable without any restrictions, public administration started to make a shift towards the establishment of an open SDI, in which also non-government data and actors are considered as a key to the performance of the infrastructure.

The concept of Open SDI is about openness to new stakeholders in the spatial data ecosystems, besides the traditional mapping agencies that have been dominant for many years. SDI development and implementation should not only involve the traditional data producers, but also key stakeholders outside the government, such as citizens, companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, NGOs and education and research institutions, which could be both producer and user of spatial data. Open SDI also is linked to developments and trends in other domains and fields, such as open government, open data, open science, open data and open software. This new paradigm on SDI means that new, particular skills are required, which currently are not offered by traditional SDI education. Open SDI education requires a shift in both the ways of teaching and learning, which should become more active, and in the content of education, include new concepts and topics. Furthermore, collaboration between higher education institutions (HEIs) is essential, since implementing - and teaching on - Open SDI requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving experts from different fields.

The main objective of the SPIDER project is to promote and strengthen active learning and teaching towards Open SDI. Sub-objectives of the project are 1) to explore, develop and implement the concept of Open SDI as a new paradigm to SDI education; 2) to promote and facilitate active and multidisciplinary learning and teaching on Open SDI; and 3) to drive the exchange and update of Open SDI teaching and learning resources by teachers and students.
